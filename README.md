# MY-PORTFOLIO

PROBLEM SOLVER <br>
Logic, Patience, communication, and attention to detail are my underlying strengths. 
I break things into manageable chunks, and tackle them with the tools at my disposal. 
Things that am into: 
Planning, building structures, thinking in systems, puzzels, adapting to change 
and learning new technologies everyday.
